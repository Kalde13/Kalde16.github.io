				<h3>My Life</h3>
				<p>
					I was born in the Philippines, where I spent my early childhood surrounded by warm, vibrant culture and breathtaking landscapes. My life took a significant turn when I moved to Japan just as I was starting junior high school. Moving to Japan for junior high school was exciting but tough. The language barrier made it hard to keep up in class and communicate with my peers. Sadly, some classmates bullied me because of my accent and mistakes, making me feel isolated.

					Despite the difficulties, a few kind students reached out and helped me improve my Japanese. Their support was a beacon of hope, and I gradually gained confidence. By the time I graduated, I had overcome the language barrier, made strong friendships, and learned the value of perseverance and kindness.
					
					My junior high school journey, though challenging, made me stronger and more empathetic.
				</p>
				<h3>My Best Friends</h3>
				<p>
					One of the most memorable and impactful experiences during my time in Japan was meeting my best friends in high school. When I moved to high school, I met my best friends who always supported me at my lowest. Their friendship became my anchor, helping me navigate the challenges and making high school an unforgettable experience. They stood by me through thick and thin, and their unwavering support meant the world to me. These friendships were forged through shared experiences, laughter, and countless hours of studying and hanging out together. They've been my support system, and we've created many unforgettable memories that I cherish to this day.
				</p>
				<h3>My favorite foods</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to the wonderful friendships, I've also developed a deep love for Japanese cuisine, particularly ramen and gyoza. Whether it's a steaming bowl of rich, savory ramen or a plate of perfectly crispy and flavorful gyoza, these dishes have become my ultimate comfort food. Exploring different ramen shops and discovering new flavors has become a delightful adventure.
				</p>
				<h3>My experience</h3>
				<p>
					Moving from the Philippines to Japan has been a transformative journey, filled with new experiences, lasting friendships, and a growing appreciation for delicious food. I look forward to continuing this adventure and seeing what the future holds.
